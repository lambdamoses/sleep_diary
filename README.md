# Sleep Diary
This is a Shiny app I built to keep a sleep diary, to identify what may help me to cope with insomnia. I have only been using it for two weeks, and I'm continuously improving it while I find out more ways that can help with insomnia and learn more about Shiny. This app has not been deployed yet, but you may clone this repo and run it locally for personal use. I still need to improve this app in many ways before I deploy it.
## To do
1. Once I accumulate enough sleep data, figure out what analysis is the most helpful for identifying what may improve insomnia and implement it in the plotting page in the app to produce a report that can be downloaded
2. Implement login screen to support multiple users
3. Right now you can only use 24 hour format to input time. It would be nice if the user can choose between 12 and 24 hour formats.
4. Try displaying data as plain text, showing data for one day at a time; the table is hard to read.
5. Allow users to download data
6. Use text mining to analyze unstructured comments
